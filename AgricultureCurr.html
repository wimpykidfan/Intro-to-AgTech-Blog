    <p> Agriculture has always been a crucial part of human survival. Food is something we all have in common, and yet food systems exist that do not bring people together. In the Agriculture portion of our program, we addressed the failure of our current food system to be regenerative or sustainable. We went over the characteristics that make a food system sustainable and three important facets of sustainability:

      more efficient cultivation of more land. Seed, irrigation, and fertilizers also have vastly improved, helping farmers increase yields. Now, agriculture is in the early days of yet another revolution, at the heart of which lie data and connectivity. Artificial intelligence, analytics, connected sensors, and other emerging technologies could further increase yields, improve the efficiency of water and other inputs, and build sustainability and resilience across crop cultivation and animal husbandry.
